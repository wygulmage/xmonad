-- A stack is a cursor onto a window list.
-- The data structure tracks focus by construction, and
-- the master window is by convention the top-most item.
-- Focus operations will not reorder the list that results from
-- flattening the cursor. The structure can be envisaged as:
--
-- >    +-- master:  < '7' >
-- > up |            [ '2' ]
-- >    +---------   [ '3' ]
-- > focus:          < '4' >
-- > dn +----------- [ '8' ]
--
-- A 'Stack' can be viewed as a list with a hole punched in it to make
-- the focused position. Under the zipper\/calculus view of such
-- structures, it is the differentiation of a [a], and integrating it
-- back has a natural implementation used in 'index'.
